The expression in his eyes told me that if we were alone, if there were no wall between us, he would&nbsp;call me by name and then kill me…. I approached the clipboard… I placed my X in the number five box. I had marked the wrong one,’ she wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the lineup, she was told by a Sergeant Lorenz, that she&nbsp;picked out the wrong person.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Alice, it’s my duty to inform you that you failed to pick out the suspect,’ she quoted him saying.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He did not tell me which one was the suspect.&nbsp;He couldn’t. But I knew. I stated for the record that in my opinion, the men in positions four and five were almost identical.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She then described how the then Assistant District Attorney Gail Uebelhoer came into the room and said: ‘Well, we got the hair out of the bastard,’ referring to Broadwater.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In Lucky, Sebold wrote that she believed she had made a mistake in the police lineup.

My lips were cut.&nbsp;I bit down on them when he grabbed me from behind&nbsp;and covered my mouth. He said these words: “I’ll kill you if you scream.” I remained motionless.&nbsp;“Do you understand? If you scream you’re dead.”&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I nodded my head. My arms were pinned to my sides by his right arm wrapped around me and my mouth was covered with his left.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She goes on to describe the rape in graphic detail, how she had to talk to the rapist to encourage him, telling him he was a ‘good man’ and how she wished it to be over.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She wrote how he then apologized in tears once the attack was over, and told her she was a ‘good girl’.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sebold describes running back to her dorm, confiding in her friends that she was just ‘beaten and raped’ in the park.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘My face smashed in, cuts across my nose and lip, a tear along my cheek. My hair was matted with leaves. My clothes were inside out and bloodied. My eyes were glazed,’ she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Months later, she said she spotted a black man in the street and thought it was him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He was smiling as he approached. He recognized me.

I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The book is told in the voice of Susie, a dead girl speaking from heaven after she has been raped and murdered.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Susie tells the harrowing tale of her vicious abduction and murder in a cornfield near her home and observes the events which follow.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>How her dismembered elbow is discovered in the field in a patch of blood, but her body is nowhere to be found.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This allows her parents to harbor a vain hope that she will be found alive.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The portrayal of her family suffering the immense grief of losing their child was what made the novel a hit with critics.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The New York Times’s Michiko Kakutani described it as ‘a deeply affecting meditation on the ways in which terrible pain and loss can be redeemed.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But others found Susie’s ability to flit between heaven and Earth an unconvincing plot device.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The ghost of the girl is glimpsed by family

class=mol-para-with-font>The novel was immensely popular, particularly with teenage girls and women.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>English author Joan Smith attacked the novel’s ‘apple-pie sentimentality’, saying it was sickly sweet.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Literary critic Philip Hensher described the book as ‘a slick, overpoweringly saccharine and unfeeling exercise in sentiment.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The novel went on to win the American Booksellers Association Book of the Year Award for Adult Fiction in 2003 and was made into a movie by fantasy-loving director Peter Jackson starring Saoirse Ronan, Susan Sarandon and Stanley Tucci.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Lovely Bones has influenced an entire sub-genre of Young Adult (YA) fiction known derisively as ‘sick lit’, which has enduring popularity to this day.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Commonly it is fiction which revolves around the afterlife where protagonists are killed early on in the narrative, finding themselves in a strange ghost world.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The hugely successful Twilight Saga, a series of fantasy romance novels by Stephenie Meyer, were influenced
